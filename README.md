**Programmer Student 👨‍💻**
Hey there, I'm a university student majoring in Computer Science from *Indonesia* 🇮🇩. 
I'm actually just starting out at programming for about 1 Year, and i may not be able to fully grasp all of the stuff in programming. 
I do my coding on Windows & Arch Linux (and no "I use Arch btw"). Arch was my **FIRST** and **ONLY** Linux experience i had so far 😂.
But the Distro that I use is Endeavour OS 🌔.

Any way, i hope with this GitHub page, i can publish my own project or even contribute to other people while also leveling up my programming skills and learn bunch of stuff in programming.
